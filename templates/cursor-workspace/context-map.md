## Scope Guide

- Frontend changes usually touch `frontend/src/`, `frontend/docs/`, Cypress specs and MSW mocks.
- Backend changes usually touch one API folder, shared layers, `backend/docs/` and tests.
- Infrastructure changes usually touch one capability folder or Terraform module plus operational docs.
- Cross-stack changes should align backend contracts, frontend services/types, mocks and tests before closing.

| Prompt index | `cursor/prompts/README.md` |
| Execution guide | `cursor/prompts/builders/universal-cursor-prompt-builder.md` |

## Cursor Rules

Active rules live under `.cursor/rules/`. Keep them short and actionable. Longer explanations, prompts and feature artifacts belong under `cursor/`.

- `company-product-context.mdc` — product/backlog docs when `cursor/company/` exists (always applied).
- `context-scope.mdc` — token-aware reads without skipping lifecycle gates.
- `core-standards.mdc` — scoped changes, no secrets, update docs/tests with contracts.
