# Context scope — session prompts

Optional reference for **token-aware chats**. Lifecycle, validation, and close criteria are unchanged — see [`AI-Project-Playbook.md`](AI-Project-Playbook.md) and `.cursor/rules/context-scope.mdc`.

Prefer a **new chat** per phase when possible. Copy a block below and fill ticket, paths, and slug.
