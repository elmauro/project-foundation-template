Task type: feature analysis package
System: __PROJECT_NAME__ continuous development
Feature slug: <feature-slug>
Feature name: <feature-name>
Ticket/story: <ticket-or-story-if-any>
Stack scope: backend | frontend | infrastructure | full-stack
Output: markdown feature package

Please execute in order:

PHASE 1 — INTAKE AND SCOPE
- Clarify goal, users/roles, expected behavior, non-goals and acceptance criteria.
- Identify stacks affected: frontend, backend, infrastructure, or combinations.
- Use `user-story-template.md` structure.
- Save or update:
  cursor/analysis/features/<feature-slug>/user-story.md

PHASE 2 — IMPACT ANALYSIS
- Identify likely modules, APIs, Lambdas, frontend pages/components/services/types, mocks/tests, data, infra and docs affected.
- For backend, check API docs, business rules, integration tests and deploy/config impact.
- For frontend, check routes, services, types, mocks, unit tests and E2E impact.
- For infrastructure, check Terraform modules, env vars, IAM and operational docs.
- Mark unknowns explicitly.
- Use `analysis-template.md` structure.
- Save:
  cursor/analysis/features/<feature-slug>/analysis.md

PHASE 3 — FEATURE MANIFEST
- Create or update status, owner, links, generated artifacts, current state and next recommended step.
- Use `feature-manifest-template.md` structure.
- Save:
  cursor/analysis/features/<feature-slug>/feature-manifest.md

Constraints:
- Do not implement code yet.
- Keep scope narrow.
- Do not scan the entire workspace unless required.
- Prefer existing project patterns.
