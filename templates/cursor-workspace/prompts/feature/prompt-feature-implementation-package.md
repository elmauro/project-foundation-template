# Prompt: Feature Implementation Package

Use this prompt when the story and analysis are ready and you want Cursor to implement the feature.

## Required inputs

- Feature slug: `<feature-slug>`
- Feature name: `<feature-name>`
- Stack scope: `backend`, `frontend`, `infrastructure` or `full-stack`

Expected inputs under `cursor/analysis/features/<feature-slug>/`:

- `user-story.md`
- `analysis.md` for complex work
- `feature-manifest.md` if the feature is tracked

Task type: feature implementation package
System: __PROJECT_NAME__ continuous development
Feature slug: <feature-slug>
Feature name: <feature-name>
Stack scope: backend | frontend | infrastructure | full-stack

Please execute in order:

PHASE 1 — READINESS CHECK
- Reconfirm scope from user-story.md and analysis.md.
- List target files/folders.
- Do not expand scope.

PHASE 2 — IMPLEMENT
- Implement only required changes.
- Backend: follow handler-service-domain/layer patterns, API docs, business rules, config and tests rules.
- Frontend: follow route, service, type, UI, mock and E2E rules.
- Infrastructure: follow Terraform/module conventions and operational docs.
- For full-stack, align backend contract before frontend integration.

PHASE 3 — IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Save concise notes with summary, decisions, impacted files, docs/tests updated and risks:
  cursor/analysis/features/<feature-slug>/implementation-notes.md
- Use `implementation-notes-template.md` structure.

PHASE 4 — TEST CHECKLIST
- Save validation checklist covering happy paths, errors, role/auth cases, API contracts, mocks, E2E and regressions:
  cursor/analysis/features/<feature-slug>/test-checklist.md
- Use `test-checklist-template.md` structure.

PHASE 5 — FEATURE MANIFEST
- Update status, completed artifacts, validation status and next step:
  cursor/analysis/features/<feature-slug>/feature-manifest.md
- Use `feature-manifest-template.md` structure.

Constraints:
- Keep changes minimal and scoped.
- Avoid broad refactors.
- Do not hardcode secrets, URLs, roles or paths.
- Mark blocked validation explicitly.
- Run focused checks when practical.
