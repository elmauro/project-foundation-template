## Automated Checks

- Backend unit/service:
  - [ ] `<command or test file>` — result:
- Backend integration:
  - [ ] `<command or test file>` — result:
- Frontend unit:
  - [ ] `<command or test file>` — result:
- E2E:
  - [ ] `<command or spec>` — result:
- Lint/build:
  - [ ] `<command>` — result:

---

## Contract / Docs Checks

- [ ] API docs updated or confirmed n/a.
- [ ] Business rules updated or confirmed n/a.
- [ ] Frontend service/types aligned with backend contract.
- [ ] Mock handlers/data aligned with service paths and response shape.
- [ ] E2E scenarios aligned with API docs and UI flow.

## GAPS

- Not executed:
  - `<check>` — reason: not executed | blocked | out of scope
- Deferred:
  - `<gap>` — source: `<analysis/user-story>`
- Unknowns:
  - `<unknown>` — evidence checked:

---

## RISKS

- Regression checks:
  - [ ] `<existing flow>` — expected result: `<unchanged behavior>`
- Integration risks:
  - [ ] `<risk>` — validation: `<check>`
- Log/monitoring checks:
  - [ ] `<log/error area>` — expected result: `<no unexpected errors>`
